2-12-18 Getting an error:
 Failed with error: unable to access 'https://github.com/stcline/Team_Repo_1.0.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
Seems like this may have something to do with my ability to write to the repo.
Need to figure out the best org structure:
WizardsRobotics
    stcline (owner) - connected via git on my laptop
        Teams
            Programmers on each team - connected via git on their laptops

Make a master repo with a module for each team and a Team Master module for me.
